# HungerLink: Linking Surplus to Needy

## Small Acts, Big Impacts

### Overview

India faces a paradox where nearly 40% of food produced goes to waste while millions suffer from food insecurity. Restaurants, grocery stores, and wedding caterers discard large amounts of edible food daily, while food banks and shelters struggle to provide meals for those in need. Factors such as inefficient food redistribution, lack of real-time coordination, and logistical challenges prevent surplus food from reaching the hungry. HungerLink aims to solve this issue through a technology-driven approach that creates an efficient, transparent, and scalable system to reduce food waste and alleviate hunger across urban and rural India.

### Our Mission

HungerLink ensures that no good food goes to waste while millions go hungry. By leveraging AI and smart technology, we connect food donors—including restaurants, supermarkets, and caterers—with NGOs and shelters that need it the most. Our goal is to create a seamless food redistribution network that is easy, efficient, and impactful, ultimately taking a step closer to a hunger-free India.
